## Wildcards    
Supports `*.txt` wildcard files, copy your wildcards into `resources\app\data\wildcards`

## Regional Condition (ComfyUI only)
**'Cause WebUI dosn't provide any regional API, sorry...**  

Get tired of [complex workflow](https://github.com/mirabarukaso/ComfyUI_Mira/issues/12#issuecomment-2727190727)?      
Try SAA Regional Condition with only 3 steps:     
1. Click the `Regional Condition` Checkbox     
2. Choose listed character or your OC      
3. Start `common prompt` with `duo, masterpiece, best quality, amazing quality`(Don't forget quality words like me), have fun!

## LoRA Slot 
WebUI supports it's default LoRA prompt style `<lora:xxxxx:1.0>`.    
ComfyUI supports more detailed configuration of LoRA, for more information please refer to [LoRA from Text](https://github.com/mirabarukaso/ComfyUI_Mira#lora).    
Also support check LoRA info by click the 'i' button in LoRA Slot. And, if there's a same named PNG file with LoRA, the image will show in LoRA info page.       

**To use LoRA in ComfyUI API, you need update your ComfyUI_Mira node to at least 0.4.9.2**

## Semi-Auto Tag Complete
Tags credits from [a1111-sd-webui-tagcomplete](https://github.com/DominikDoom/a1111-sd-webui-tagcomplete/blob/main/tags/danbooru_e621_merged.csv)    

Entering the `first few characters` will automatically search for matching tags, starting with `*` will search for tags with a specific ending, and `*tag*` will search for tags that match in the middle.    
Use `mouse` to select the prompt word, but you can also use the `keyboard up and down` with `Enter` or `Tab` to select, press `Esc` to close the prompt box.     
`ctrl + up` and `ctrl + down` arrow to adjust the weight of the current tag, or adjust multiple tags by selecting a fragment, the usage is similar to comfyui and webui, but some details of the logic may be different.

## Image info
Just drag your image into SAA window, only support PNG for now.     
Works both for WebUI and ComfyUI(with image save node).      
Double click the image to close.     
The `Send` button will override `Common Prompt`, `Negative Prompt`, `Width & Height`, `CFG`, `Setp` and `Seed`.    
LoRA in `Common Prompt` also works if you have the same one. If you don't like LoRA in prompts, try `Send LoRA to Slot`.

## Realtime Character preview and Search

## Right Click Menu
I just noticed that the electron app doesn't have a right-click menu, so I made one.     

**Spell Check (English)**    
Right-click on a word that has a spell check error (a wavy line drawn at the bottom) to see a hint for the corresponding word.     
<img src="https://github.com/mirabarukaso/character_select_stand_alone_app/blob/main/examples/spellCheck.png" width=45% height=45%>

**AI prompt generate test**     
Right click on `AI prompt` to get AI promot without generate.     
Once got result from Remote/Local AI, an information overlay will show in screen, switch AI rule to `Last` to keep  the result in later generate.

**Copy Image/Metadata**     
Right click on `Gallery` to copy current image or copy the metadata to clipboard.     
ComfyUI with Image Saver node will output an a1111 like metadata.      
Copy image based on convert base64 data back to png, so I didn't put metadata back, ~because most social software will trim it again.~ The truth is metadata trimed by chromium core, it's impossible to put them back with chromium API, a C based lib could solve that problem, but it's not worth to do. If you do need the original image, try dragging and dropping or getting it from the relevant (ComfyUI/WebUI) output folder.

**Send LoRA to Slot**     
Right click on `Common` and `Positive` to send text form LoRA to LoRA Slot.

# Hires Fix and Image Color Transfer
Please refer to [Image Color Transfer](https://github.com/mirabarukaso/ComfyUI_Mira#image-color-transfer) for more details about Image Color Transfer.   

*Due to lack of generate rule and missing openCV, Color transfer no longer support in WebUI*

1. WeuUI will(I think...) download upscale models itself, select any model end with `(W)` will work for WebUI.   
2. Comfyui needs to download upscale models by yourself. Select `Manager`->`Model Manager` and filter with `upscale`, then download them.   
3. Upscale model list can be modity in your `settings.json` -> `api_hf_upscaler_list`    
3.1. For WebUI, copy and paste them from WebUI, and add `(W)` in the end.        
3.2. For ComfyUI, check your model's name from `ComfyUI/models/upscale_models`, and add `(C)` in the end.

# FAQ
Double clicked `saa.exe` but nothing happen?    
1. It might caused by files download issue or missing files.    
2. Try run it in console, by input `cmd` in your Explorer's address bar to open a console.      
3. Type `saa` then enter in console, check backend logs for more information.     

I messed up with setup wizard...      
1. Close the App    
2. Delete `settings.json` in `resources/app/settings`     
3. Try it again     

ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED       
1. In most cases, it's the wrong address for the (ComfyUI/WebUI) back-end API.
